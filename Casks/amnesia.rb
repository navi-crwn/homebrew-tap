  caveats <<~EOS
    Amnesia really deletes data once you turn it on. Read the terms first:
      https://github.com/navi-crwn/amnesia-mac/blob/main/TERMS.md
    To uninstall: brew uninstall --cask amnesia (turns Amnesia off safely).
    To also delete the vault and settings: bash ~/.amnesia/uninstall.sh --all
